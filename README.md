“Main challenges were the miniaturization of the computer hardware, head mounted display technology, connectivity, and battery lifetimes. As computing technology in general progressed, these technical issues (with the possible exception of battery lifetime) became less constraining.”

"Medical education is changing. Simulation is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of clinical training and, though effective, is resource intensive. With increasing pressures on budgets and standardisation, virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a new method of delivering simulation. VR offers benefits for learners and educators, delivering cost-effective, repeatable, standardised clinical training on demand. A large body of evidence supports VR simulation in all industries, including healthcare. Though VR is not a panacea, it is a powerful educational tool for defined learning objectives and implementation is growing worldwide. The future of VR lies in its ongoing integration into curricula and with technological developments that allow shared simulated clinical experiences. This will facilitate quality interprofessional education at scale, independent of geography, and transform how we deliver education to the clinicians of the future."

A book about the future of healthcare and the way in which technology has impacted its delivery. 

Really interesting way of looking at healthcare’s changes over the past decade and implications for the future . “The marked connectivity is taken futher when one considers the internet of things. That is, the unbridled growth of not only people but also devices connected wirelessly via the internet. The projections range from twenty eight to fifty billion connected devides by 2020, and the implications are profound. This doesn’t just refer to Nest thermometers or connected cars – the bulk of the growth is actually expected to come from sensors, particularly wearable ones the track medical data. …The impressive growth of our connectivity – between both people and machines – represents a formidable technologic force that makes medicine’s democratisation more likely and more powerful” (Topol, 2015) Really fascinating stuff!!

 I’m interested in the connection not only between application for technology and healthcare but also its effect on patient attitudes. 
 
 “For the past decade, design of healthcare technology has been a strategic arena in product development in Denmark. Danish foresight reports on robotics and aging conclude that integration of robot technology would help the functional ability of the elderly and disabled.4 The reports reveal an important opportunity to create an age-integrated society where product innovation is based on: ”[...] multidisciplinary interaction, the welfare model, and the Danish labor market model.”5 The robotics study concludes that robots have great potential for alleviating critical problems and promoting innovation in areas of importance to society” (Søsser Hansen Brodersen, 2015)
 
One such researcher is Oudshoorn,15 who argues that “because human work is delegated to digital machines, face-to-face contacts between healthcare professionals, and ill patients, decrease because they are partly replaced by ICT-mediated clinical encounters.” Oudshoorn argues that this development is problematic because it neglects what she calls the “invisible work,” referring to the work involved in operating all the new technologies and devices (Søsser Hansen Brodersen, 2015)

“ The relevance of AI in healthcare is proved by the fact that such important figures at IT market as IBM and Google are developing solutions in this field. For example, IBM Watson, a question-answering computer system, offers applications for healthcare. Watson uses natural language capabilities, hypothesis generation, and evidence-based learning to support medical professionals as they make decisions [8]. DeepMind Technologies, a British AI company which belongs to Google, in 2016 opened a department DeepMind Health that works in the field of AI in medicine. Two main goals are claimed at this department: first, to make a practical difference to patients, nurses and doctors and support the National Health Service and other healthcare systems; and second, to make DeepMind Health a selfsustaining initiative “ (Oksana Illiashenko, 2019)

“How might machine learning and deep learning transform the current medical, and specifically the musculoskeletal, landscape? Search engines, spam filters, voice recognition software, and autonomous driving vehicles all depend on ML technologies and are now part of our daily lives, irrespective of the industry sector we occupy. Medicine seems particularly amenable to ML solutions and has been the focus of much interest in thriving technological economies, such as Silicon Valley.” (L D Jones, 2018)

“A related concern is that data companies could tempt people to give up their privacy in return for medical care or financial reward. Such practices could create a privacy divide between rich and poor along the same lines as the digital divide that already separates different socio-economic groups5.” (Kasper M Johannesen, 2018-02)

Not all systems need to replace humans, but rather help to manage and support in their works

Platform for innovation in medical and Health Technologies is a network of healthcare centers who focus on innovation within medical and health tech, as they feel it is essential for sustaining the Spanish Healthcare system .

 “a number common problems with electronic health record systems (EHRs) and cognitive aid use in safety-critical environments. This includes problems with technology usability and workarounds clinicians employ to manage team size and roles. Third, I identified problems with clinicians fixating and becoming distracted by cognitive aids in safety-critical scenarios. Clinicians often over-rely on cognitive aids, to the point where it directly interferes with how they deliver care and their situational awareness. Fourth, I designed and developed Visual TASK to support team situational awareness with the capability to adapt to end-user needs. Visual TASK provides a shared resource display for the entire team to guide them through a procedure.”


“These systems are designed to ensure that HCWs perform HH before approaching the patient's bedside, and issue an alert to do so. They can use sensors that detect alcohol vapours 18, or radiofrequency identification to determine whether HH has occurred 13. “ (Elena Shulzhenko, 2020)

 “Specifically, there is a need to confront in practice the ways technique influences care. Technique is the creation of a kind of thinking that is necessary for contemporary healthcare technology to develop and be applied in an efficient and rational manner. Technique is not an entity or specific thing, but rather a way of thinking that seeks to shape and organize nursing activity, and manage efficiently individual difference(s) in care.” (Barnard, 2015)
“Nursing is a practical occupation and our knowledge is expressed most often through the way we perform our work, especially as wisdom and choices we make in practice. Technology not only encompasses new and old machinery, automata, utensils, equipment, and a range of objects from ventilators through to bed pans, but also the development of related knowledge and skills.” (Barnard, 2015)
“An intravenous pump automatically controlling a solution injected into a person's vein is tangible and clinically useful; but the effect(s) of spending less time with the person as a result is less obvious or even made known. The immediate effects of controlling intravenous therapy are measurable, but if there is inability for the same patients to express their fears or ask questions about their care, this is not calculated.” (Barnard, 2015)


“wearable context monitoring allows long-term recording of patient activity and situations to which he has been exposed. Such information can be used to annotate physiological data allowing the physician to better judge its significance. In addition, activity information can be a valuable diagnostic tool on its own, in particular in connection with cognitive and mental disorders.” (Lukowicz, 2008)
“The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into our digital healthcare system is seen as a significant strategy to contain Australia’s rising healthcare costs, support clinical decision making, manage chronic disease burden and support our ageing population.” (Ellwn E Lee, 2019)

“The perception that AI would replace them in the healthcare setting was not evident. This may be due to the fact that AI is not yet at the forefront of technology use in healthcare setting. More research is needed to examine the experiences and perceptions of healthcare professionals using AI in the delivery of healthcare.” (Ellwn E Lee, 2019)
 “With the increasing roll-out of ‘digital hospitals’, electronic medical records, new data capture and analysis technologies, as well as a digitally enabled health consumer, the Australian healthcare workforce is required to become digitally literate to manage the significant changes in the healthcare landscape.” (Ellwn E Lee, 2019)
“It can be general or narrow in definition depending on its performance and use of data,23,34 and because of this, a widely accepted definition of AI in health has not yet been established. “ (Ellwn E Lee, 2019)


“The concept of wearable computing can be traced back to a roulette prediction computer first mentioned by E. Thorp in 1966 (see [1] for a new summary). The system was a cigarette-pack sized analog computer with four push buttons. A data-taker would use the buttons to indicate the speed of the roulette wheel, and the computer would then send tones via radio to a player's hearing aid. While the merit of such a system is certainly arguable, it very well illustrates the two a main properties that define Wearable Systems.” (Lukowicz, 2008)

“At the moment, an ethical consensus has not yet emerged as to whether disclosing the use of an opaque medical AI algorithm should be a mandatory requirement of informed consent. A failure to disclose the use of an opaque AI system may undermine patients’ autonomy and negatively impact the doctor-patient relationship, jeopardizing patients’ trust, and might violate the compliance with clinical recommendations. If the patient were to find out in hindsight that a clinician’s recommendation was derived from an opaque AI system, this may lead the patient to not only challenge the recommendation but might also lead to a justified request for explanation—which in the case of an opaque system, the clinician would not be able to provide. Opaque medical AI can, therefore, represent an obstacle to the provision of accurate information and thus potentially jeopardize informed consent.”

“Explainability can address this issue by providing clinicians and patients with a personalized conversation aid that is based on the patient’s individual characteristics and risk factors. By simulating the impact of different treatment or lifestyle interventions, an explainable AI decision aid could help to raise patients’ choice awareness and support clinicians in eliciting patient values and preferences [34]. As described previously, explainability provides a visual representation or natural language explanation of how different factors contributed to the final risk assessment. “ (Julia Amann, 2020)


“An efficient health care system must enhance the ability of medical professionals and their patients to make informed choices about the adoption and use of new technologies, even when insurers do not explicitly provide reimbursement for these new technologies.” (Sherry A Glied, 2010)

“Healthcare providers face rising demand and pressures for cost containment. The development of relatively low cost and routine technologies – principally digitization of images and documents, electronic databases and broadband internet and intranet – promises the more efficient use of resources and improved quality of services (Rigby 1999; Lehoux et al. 2002; May et al. 2005).” (Halford, et al., 2010)
Could these things make healthcare more efficient ?  


“In short, the dynamics of producing and re-producing social orders of healthcare work and organization are mediated by relations of power, knowledge and identity and – at the same time – are productive of power, knowledge and identities. In making these claims, we sound an echo of Strauss et al.'s (1963/1994) conceptualization of the ‘negotiated order’ between medicine and nursing. Rather than seeing relations between medicine and nursing as fixed structural features of health care, Strauss et al. focused attention on the detailed interactions between doctors and nurses as the mechanism of social order.” (Halford, et al., 2010)

There are nuances between the relationships of healthcare professionals below and above in scope of practice, how would a robot or healthcare tech assistant fall into the social hierarchy? 

“Doctors and patients often embrace new modes of treatment before their merits and weaknesses are fully understood. “ (Sherry A Glied, 2010)

“It is unlikely that robot-assisted surgeries will completely replace conventional surgeries for the full range of procedures for which cost studies have been done. If such a substitution did occur, however, it would generate nearly $1.5 billion in additional health care costs annually — excluding the (amortized) costs of the robots, which would bring the total to more than $2.5 billion. If robots also led to an increase in the volume of surgery performed, as suggested by the prostatectomy case, their effect on total annual expenditures would be even greater.” (Sherry A Glied, 2010)
